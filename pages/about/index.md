Great Moments in History was originally formed in January of 2008 on Destromath-US.  With considerable experience playing Vanilla, we progressed into one of top guilds on the server during TBC and WotLK.  With the love of min/maxing firmly intact, we have since turned to more casual-friendly and less time-sensitive ambitions such as AotC/Heroic-mode raiding, high-level Mythic+ dungeons and Achievement Runs since WoD.

We are an eclectic mix of mature gamers with a shared love of World of Warcraft and Blizzard games.  Our members play across all North American timezones where you'll find us raiding, running dungeons, levelling alts, talking about video games or discovering our next Great guild meme.

We are currently looking for friendly (and competent) team members of all specs and roles to fill out our Classic roster for raiding.  While we maintain performance expectations to ensure timely and efficient raid clears, we welcome any players with a good attitude who are open to learn, help each other and improve their play.
