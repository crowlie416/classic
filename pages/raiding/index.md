## Raid Schedule
Tuesdays and Thursdays between 6pm - 9:30pm PST

<hr class="divider">

## Raiding Expectations
- Be knowledgeable about raid encounters, how your class/role can best add value to the team and be open to constructive criticism
- Be prepared with enchants, consumables and make efforts towards obtaining your pre-raid gear/attunements (guild will help with this)
- Be mature and respectful to other raid members
- Be reliable: real life happens and we do not expect 100% raid attendance - just be sure to let the raid know when you cannot attend


### Behavior
- While we are a mature guild that allows mature (or rather immature) humor and profanity, please help keep the guild a harassment-free space for everyone. &lt;Great Moments in History&gt; prohibits harassment based on performance, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). If someone asks you to stop, be willing to apologize and move on.
- If you are having issues with another raid member, please contact an officer to resolve the issue.
- Contact officers with your concerns after (not during) raids, so we can properly give your issue the attention it deserves.
- Act maturely and responsibly in and outside of raid. You are a representative of our guild, and our guild treats everyone with respect.


### Guidelines for Great Raiding

- Know your class. Use your potions, healthstones, dispels, cooldowns, etc.
- Research your class and perform well with respect to your role. If you’re having issues getting to where you think you should be performing, please get in touch with an officer for tips, guidelines, and help with learning strategies.
- Talk to your fellow teammates. Sharing what works and what doesn’t is how we all get better.
- Know the fights. Follow raid directions. Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s important to learn from them and take them seriously.
- If you have suggestions about minor changes we can make to strategy, feel free to bring it up in raid. If it’s a major change, it may be best to discuss it in Discord or on the forums after raid.
- Come prepared. Come to raid equipped with flasks, potions, food, and any other consumable that may boost your performance (optional for Ony/MC). The guild will help provide these as much as possible.
